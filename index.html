                Natalia is who she is. A verb more than an adjective,
                she embodies a Founder-in-Chief, community builder
                extraordinaire and resident  madrina  to the many
                businesses, organizations and humans she helps develop.
                An organizational psychologist and technologist by training,
                she is laser focused on merging innovation, entrepreneurship,
                and impact--this last one being the most important to her.
                Whether it's business, civic engagement, or the arts
                (yes, her brain and work often spans across all areas)
                Natalia's solution to everything is collaboration and
                creating communities that are truly inclusive ecosystems.
                This dedication is informed  by her life as a twice-immigrant,
                interest in cross-disciplinary intersections,
                fascination with complex systems, and desire to bridge
                opportunity gaps. Currently, she has done so by leading
                the expansion of the Cambridge Innovation Center to Miami.
                CIC is the US’ oldest and largest gathering hub of startup
                activity, labeled a leader in creating innovation districts
                due to their economic impact, urban development, and community
                engagement initiatives. Since launching CIC in Miami, Natalia
                has grown it into a $2M+ business and has overseen various
                initiatives to deepen and nuance the conversation about
                entrepreneurship, accelerate Miami's economic development,
                and build tangible bridges to innovation hubs and Latin
                America but always with compassion; a must in her values'
                book.

                She is the Founder of Awesome Foundation MIAMI, a micro-grant
                organization that has awarded close to $100K to small,
                grassroots ideas in Miami. She is also the Founder of
                Aminta Ventures, an educational vehicle to empower more
                female angel investors in South Florida as well as a founding
                board member of Local TAU, a spin-off platform connecting
                Tel Aviv University to Miami. Natalia serves as the Vice
                President of LatAm Expansion for the Latino Startup Alliance,
                is a member of the World Economic Forum, and has been
                appointed by Florida Governor Rick Scott to serve on the
                Governor’s Commission on Community Service, a body that
                oversees the administration of $24 million in federal, state,
                and local funding to deliver high-impact educational and
                volunteer programs in Florida.

                When done exercising her left brain, her right brain kicks
                in. She's the co-creator and curator of "Love Lost, Miami,"
                an annual art exhibit hoping to share a spotlight of the
                stories of loss through personal and ordinary items that
                come alive with their stories. A dedicated fan of jazz and
                the opera, she is also a talented amateur photographer and
                infuses her own vodka.

                A true tour de force, Natalia's body of work is the reason
