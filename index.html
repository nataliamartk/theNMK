                    Natalia is who she is. A verb more than a noun, she embodies a
                    Founder-in-Chief, community builder extraordinaire and resident
                    <em>madrina</em> to the many businesses, organizations and humans she helps
                    incubate, develop and thrive. An organizational psychologist and
                    technologist with degrees from Harvard and Columbia University,
                    she is laser focused on merging innovation, entrepreneurship, and
                    lasting impact with heart—the latter being the most important to
                    her.  Whether it's business, civic engagement, or the arts (yes,
                    her brain and work often spans across all areas) Natalia's solution
                    to everything is collaboration and creating communities that are
                    truly inclusive ecosystems with aplomb. Just look at what she did
                    with Cambridge Innovation Center’s
                    <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article38767662.html"
                       target="_blank">Miami expansion</a>
                    in <a href="https://thenewtropic.com/cic-miami/" target="_blank">
                    under a year</a>.
                    Her dedication is informed by her life as a twice-immigrant <em>née</em> to
                    Russian and Cuban parents, an interdisciplinary approach to life
                    and a fascination with complex systems.
                </p>

                    <a href="http://localtau.org" target="_blank">LocalTAU</a>. Natalia serves as
                    the Vice President of LatAm Expansion for the Latino Startup Alliance,
                    is a member of the World Economic Forum, and was appointed by Florida
                    Governor Rick Scott to serve on the Governor’s Commission on Community
                    Service. When done exercising her left brain, her right brain kicks
                    in. She's the co-creator and curator of "Love Lost, Miami," an annual
                    art exhibit that explores loss through personal and ordinary items that
                    come alive with their stories. A dedicated fan of jazz and the opera,
                    she is also a talented amateur photographer and infuses her own vodka.
                    Natalia is a cat mom, <em>porteña</em> by choice, a regular speaker and contributor
                    to outlets such as The Huffington Post, the World Economic Forum, Mic,
                    and La Nation. A true <em>tour de force</em>, Natalia's being of work is the
